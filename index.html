<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Hello everyone.</h1></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><h3>My name is jackson. and i am the owner of the jschultz.ca domain name.</h3></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><h4>The raefer cult SMP. Is a project i helped on, and was the technical owner of. However due to recent events i am no-longer able to support the project, or raefer.</h4></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><h4>Raefer has said some horrible things towards the community members, and i did nothing to prevent it. And im sorry for my lack of action to prevent this from happening.</h4></div>
<p>With that being said, the minecraft servers ip smp.jschultz.ca is dead. and will be for the forseeable future (unless i reboot it w/ someone who isnt an asshole(foreshadowing isnt it))</p>
<h4>For the time being, i want nothing to do with raefer and what he has done.</h4>
<h3>I would also like to personally appologize to the following people:</h3>
<h4>High Voltage</h4>
<p>You spent an enormous amount of time on the server, and i even convinced you to build me a base. Its unfortunate it had to go to waste like this.</p>
<h4>Cinder, Freya, Syd</h4>
<p>You were all borderline sexually harassed by raefer. and i stood by and let it happen, I should have done something to prevent it.</p>
<h4>and lastly, You. The community</h4>
<p>Im sorry for enabling raefer to do all of this, and not using my position to prevent it. If you want to reach out, and talk my dms are open. JacksonS#2344</p>
<p>ps. cinders starting a cult, given how this went down last time with raefer, i probably shouldnt be immediately hopping on board but oh well</p>
